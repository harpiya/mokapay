## AuthorizeNet

Authorize.Net gateway integration for ERPNext

This gateway allows authenticated users to store payment information to ease checkout on later purchases. 

No credit card information is ever stored in the server, rather Authorize.Net stores the information while this gateway stores a token to reuse later.
